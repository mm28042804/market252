# Germany Aerospace Plastic Flame Retardant Market Industry Outline, Future Patterns and Breakdown with Market Drivers By 2033

<strong>Aerospace Plastic Flame Retardant Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Flame retardants are a class of auxiliaries that inhibit the combustibility of polymers. They are mostly compounds of Group V, VII and III elements of the Periodic Table of the Elements; in particular, compounds of phosphorus, bromine, chlorine, gallium and aluminum. There are two types of flame retardants, additive and reactive. Additive flame retardants are mainly phosphate esters and halogenated phosphates, halogenated hydrocarbons, antimony oxides, and aluminum hydroxides. The advantages are easy to use and adaptable. However, due to the added amount of 10% to 30%, often affect the performance of plastics. Reactive flame retardants are actually monomers containing flame-retardant elements, so they have little effect on plastic properties. Common reactive flame retardants such as halogenated anhydrides for polyesters, tetrabromobisphenol A for epoxy resins, and phosphorus-containing polyols for polyurethanes.
